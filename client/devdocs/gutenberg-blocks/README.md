Gutenberg Blocks
====

[Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) is the new publishing experience for WordPress.

The Gutenberg editor uses 
[blocks](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/master/blocks/README.md) to create all types
of content. A Gutenberg block is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that, 
composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage.

Calypso provides all the 
[built-in Gutenberg blocks](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/master/core-blocks), so 
they can be used in any React component.
